# Calculator
Hello, it's project that's make in vanilla.js

In future I'll add new features like:
* Distinguish first operator calculate (First is multiply, divide, add, subtract),
* Add braces function, that it's first in counting,
* add hamburger nav that can change functionality of calculator (Standard -> Programming & vice versa)
* Add binary, decimal and hex function
